						<p>Welcome to my world. My name is Jack, a second year student who is currently studying computer science and 	business double degree program in University of Waterloo. My passion and interest in programming has started since elementary 	school, which then leads to various computer contests awards, projects, and work experience focusing on the field of web development. More detailed information regarding to my projects can be found in the project section.
Started as a hobbyist, I have been doing magic professionally for more then 4 years. The shows ranges from semi-formal party, new year gala, special date event, cabaret talent show, etc. </p>
