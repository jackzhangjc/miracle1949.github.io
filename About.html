						<p> All the information about the following projects can be found at my personal website at http://miracle1949.github.io/project. First, I developed an IOS app called UWCourse (itunes.apple.com/ca/app/uwcourses/id864114842?mt=8), and have gained much Objective-C and MVC experience from it. The app allows users to add courses, automatically display a time table and a user-friendly list of exam countdowns, utilizing  coredata, UW public API, and EventKit. Moreover, I have done two coop terms working as software developer, mainly as a web developer. During work term I had extensive experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, SQL, database, different API (Google Map, FB plugin), MVC design pattern, and have developed web application such as virtual inspector and mobile site such as (http://m.leadingindicator.ca/). I am a hard working student and employee, as I have earned outstanding for my last coop term. Furthermore, I have participated many computer  competitions since high school, and have won the Canadian Computing Competition honorable mention, and is attending the ACM North American Qualification contest this Saturday. I simply love coding, thus I attended Hack the North hackthon and built a Google map streetview that can be controlled using Myo. I am also working as a part-time research assistant currently working on a compiling main-memory database that translates SQL-like queries to C code. From high school to now, I have more than 4 years of experience in Java and Pascal, and have done multiple projects and competitions. </p>
